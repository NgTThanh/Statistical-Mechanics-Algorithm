# Statistical-Mechanics-Algorithm
This repository is produced as solution for exercises of the course "Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations" on Coursera, which go through simple ideas in statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo simulation.

These are branches corresponding to Lectures in the course. My assignments for the excercise is specified in each folder. The course go through:
Lecture 1: Introduction to Monte Carlo algorithms

Lecture 2: Hard disks: from Classical Mechanics to Statistical Mechanics

Lecture 3: Entropic interactions, phase transitions

Lecture 4: Sampling and Integration - From Gaussians to the Maxwell and Boltzmann distributions

Lecture 5: Density matrices and path integrals

Lecture 6: LÃ©vy sampling of quantum paths

Lecture 7: Quantum indiscernability and Bose-Einstein condensation

Lecture 8: Ising model - From enumeration to Cluster Monte Carlo Simulations

Lecture 9: Dynamical Monte Carlo and the Faster-than-the-Clock approach

Lecture 10: The Alpha and the Omega of Monte Carlo

The textbook for the course is Krauth, W. (2006). Statistical mechanics: algorithms and computations (Vol. 13). OUP Oxford.
